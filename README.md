# std-lang-demo

Handson Clojure std.lang Multi transpiler library designed to be A Playground for Languages
There are so many languages currently out there is the world. Every single one of them has their own quirks but each are inspired by one another.

std.lang creates an environment where multiple languages and multiple runtimes can be mixed, matched and integrated to get the basic minimum piece of code working.

When the benefits of repl driven development can be made available to any language, programming then becomes about the code itself and not everything around making the code work
